# Scale-of-Justice
 Game for 2023 Game Off Game Jam

## Executive Summary
*Scales of Justice* will portray the frantic pace required of a pbulic defender short on time and resources. There will be an ongoing countdown before the player/attorney fails at their impossible job. While there is opportunity for much more, this first version will focus on navigating a courthouse and a few concepts of court processess.

## Gameplay
The counter will start with a certain amount of time on the clock. As the public defender, the player will navigate, in 3rd person, the courtroom. The player will be pointed to the next indicated courtroom. Once in the courtroom there will be one of 3 minigames (can always add more in the future.) Each successful completion adds time to the clock and charges the "Thumb on the Scale" meter. Once charged, the player can put the thumb on the scale for one quick execution of a minimgame.

## Mechanics
There will be obstacels to jump and dodge as the player runs through the court building. Controls will be the mouse and keyboard, with likely option for game controller. If time some of the minigame, may be click and drop mechanics, but otherwise likely keep mouse, keyboard controls. One minigame will be collecting statements that are objectionable - to object, but require dodging the non-objectionable statements that will add up sustained objections. Too many sustained objections result in a contempt charge. Another minigame will be collecting and fitting together pieces of evidence to package and give to the clerk. A minigame will also include winning over the jury with correct pressing of buttons in order and in time.

## Game Elements
Courtroom: Judge, clerk, jury, prosecuting attorney, client and the player. Desks, podium, witness stand, benches for the gallery.
A frazzled public defender is only superficially connecting with the client to start the minigames.
The courthouse is busy with spilled sodas, peaple, briefcases, papers, trash cans, maps + water.

## Assets
Music - something with gavel sounds and frantic.
Sound effects: Epic announcements of legal concepts (e.g. "Habius Corpus," "Affirmative Defense," "Motion for continuance.") 3d models of characters - most attention on the attorney's and judge. Peoople for the courthouse, obstacels in the courthouse.
Fonts: Will want serrif, legal document looking script.
